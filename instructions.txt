For checking the installed version :
	ng version
	ng --version

For creating the angular application :
	ng new <project-name> --no-standalone
	cd <project-name>
	ng serve
	
	-> It will run the aplication on URL : http://localhost:4200/

	-> Default application running port is 4200, but you can change port by following command:
	ng serve --port 4201
	ng serve --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080
	

For creating a component :
	cd <project-name>
	ng generate component <component-name>   OR ng g c <comoponent-name>
	
	-> This will create necessary files for new component inside the 'src/app/<your-component-name>' directory.


For creating service :
	ng generate service <service-name>
	
	-> This command generates necessary files for a new service inside the 'src/app' directory.

For creating Interceptor :
	ng g interceptor <interceptor-name>
	
	-> It is a middleware-like mechanism that you can use to intercept and modify requests-responses globally.
